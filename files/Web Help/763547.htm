<p class="bodytext">The total costs of an agreement are calculated under consideration of the line item quantities and unit prices, the line item other costs, and the agreement other costs. The calculation of change order (CO) total costs includes all previous agreement supplements. If only the costs of the actual CO shall be calculated, the project default ZP_CODELTA must be set to Y.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The last, changed, and total cost are automatically calculated and cannot be changed. The last cost is the total cost of the agreement prior to the creation of a CO, and the changed cost is the difference between the previous and the actual total cost. Both, the last and changed cost value are 0 (zero) in case of an agreement supplement 0.</p>
<p class="bodytext">To apply a tax rate on the total costs of an agreement, proceed as follows.</p>
<ol class="listnumber"><li class="listnumber">Select the <strong class="specialbold">Tax </strong>check box.<p class="listcontinue">The value assigned to project default ZP_TAX is set as default in the <strong class="specialbold">Tax % </strong>cell.</p>
