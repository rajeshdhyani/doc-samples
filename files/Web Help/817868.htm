<p class="bodytext">As an expediter, you ensure that the ordered materials reach the sites on time. You also have to coordinate the inspection and material certification process to verify the proper quality of the shipped items.  </p>
<p class="bodytext">As soon as a purchase order (PO) or notice of commitment (NOC) is approved, it is available in the <strong class="specialbold">Expediting </strong>section. The expediter is responsible for the agreement until the material is received on site. This is a very important responsibility, and it requires monitoring and managing a significant amount of information. Smart Materials has several features to help you. </p>
<p class="bodytext">In the expediting phase, you manage important documents like material certificates, inspection release certificates, and release notes. You also have to be concerned with fabrication information, delivery information, and routing methods.</p>

<p class="bodytext">You can view all the approved agreements in the expediting tree. </p>
<p class="bodytext">Select an agreement to view a quick summary of it and find out who the supplier is, what the engineering requisition number is, total item shipment quantity, and so on.</p>
<p class="bodytext">As an expediter, you have to create and maintain two very important sets of documents: material certificate summaries (MCSs) and inspection release certificates (IRCs). An MCS indicates the certification details of an item, and an IRC indicates the completion of the inspection process and authorizes the inspected items for handling. The <strong class="specialbold">Inspection and Shipping Releases</strong> tab displays the existing MCSs and IRCs.</p>
<p class="bodytext">After the completion of the inspection process you need to create release notes. Until you create the release notes, the supplier cannot start the packing process.</p>
