It provides a common collaboration platform and project workbench for all partners in any engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) project supply chain.  Smart Materials helps to lower project costs, compress schedules, improve risk management, and prepare companies to act globally to maintain advantage in a highly complex, international, and competitive market.  From initial cost estimation through the supply chain to on-site management, Smart Materials handles materials standardization, bills of materials (BOM) and requisitions, procurement functions, fabrication tracking, and site functions, such as warehousing and disposition.  In the following graphic, you can see a high level representation of the key tasks in Smart Materials.  The engineering division creates the BOM (this is the list of everything needed to deliver the project), and hands over a requisition (summarized BOM - this is the list of what needs to be bought).  Once the procurement division receives the requisition, they begin the process of sourcing and scheduling. They create purchase orders and ensure that suppliers are lined up to create goods or provide labor on time for each stage in the process.  The expediting division manages the logistics by following up on orders to ensure that materials are manufactured, inspected and ready for shipment on time. From then on, the traffic coordinator takes over. The traffic coordinator oversees the packing and shipment process. The traffic coordinator interacts with the suppliers and freight forwarders to ensure that the required items arrive on time at the site. Once all of the materials are on site, the procurement division hands over the project to the construction team.  The construction team receives, issues and tracks the materials, maintains the inventory over the lifecycle of the project, manages work packages, and responds to design changes.   Efficient, on-time delivery of the project depends on seamless integration across this value chain.  "},{"id":25,"title":"Getting Started with Agreements","url":"817866.htm","text":"An agreement is a contract between the buyer and the supplier or subcontractor. An agreement defines all the requirements that the supplier or the subcontractor needs to meet during the course of the agreement.  You create an agreement after evaluating the bids from different suppliers and identifying the supplier whom you want to award the contract. The following diagram shows when agreements come into the picture in the material management process.  Depending on your requirements, you might need to create different types of agreements. Agreements can be broadly classified into two groups: orders, and subcontracts.   Type  Details and examples  Order  An order can be different types, like blanket order, field order, change order, rental order, notice of commitment, manual order, or purchase order.   Subcontract  A subcontract can be rental order, field order, service agreement, subcontract, or work order.  Every agreement has an agreement number that uniquely identifies that agreement. An agreement also has various sections like vendor details, delivery details, financial details, and so on.  Depending on your role, you might need to view and edit the entire agreement or some part of the agreement. After an agreement is created and reviewed, it needs to be approved by somebody with the required authority. Depending on the workflow configuration, approvals can be a single step or a multi-step process. For multi-step approvals, after the approval is sent from each approver, a final approval needs to be performed from the buyer organization. After the approval process is complete, you issue the agreement to the supplier.  View the Intergraph Smart Materials Agreements User's Guide for more information on agreements.  "},{"id":26,"title":"Getting Started with Expediting","url":"817868.htm","text":"As an expediter, you ensure that the ordered materials reach the sites on time. You also have to coordinate the inspection and material certification process to verify the proper quality of the shipped items.    As soon as a purchase order (PO) or notice of commitment (NOC) is approved, it is available in the Expediting section. The expediter is responsible for the agreement until the material is received on site. This is a very important responsibility, and it requires monitoring and managing a significant amount of information. Smart Materials has several features to help you.   In the expediting phase, you manage important documents like material certificates, inspection release certificates, and release notes. You also have to be concerned with fabrication information, delivery information, and routing methods.  You can view all the approved agreements in the expediting tree.   Select an agreement to view a quick summary of it and find out who the supplier is, what the engineering requisition number is, total item shipment quantity, and so on.  As an expediter, you have to create and maintain two very important sets of documents: material certificate summaries (MCSs) and inspection release certificates (IRCs). An MCS indicates the certification details of an item, and an IRC indicates the completion of the inspection process and authorizes the inspected items for handling. The Inspection and Shipping Releases tab displays the existing MCSs and IRCs.  After the completion of the inspection process you need to create release notes. Until you create the release notes, the supplier cannot start the packing process.  View the Intergraph Smart Materials Expediting User's Guide for more information on expediting tasks.

To configure Smart Materials, you can need to define master data in three categories:  Administration - With the administrative data, you can customize the Smart Materials administration for your requirements. For example, you can define the different roles that require access to Smart Materials for day to day work.   Procurement - With procurement related master data, you can configure various aspects of the procurement process. For example, you can define the container types that are available during the shipping process. You can also define the geographical areas that are used for price codes and delivery places.  Site - The site related master data defines various aspects of the site related tasks. For example, you can define the clearance types and incident types.  After defining master data, you can edit it or delete it if required.  View the Intergraph Smart Materials Master Data User's Guide for more information on master data.   "},{"id":28,"title":"Getting Started with Planning","url":"819098.htm","text":"Planning is an extremely important part of materials management. Without proper planning, your organization might end up spending much more in the procurement and construction phase. With Smart Materials, you can define milestones for your project, and you can track the progress of important activities at the same time. You can also define and change your strategies for meeting your milestones.  The first step of planning is to identify the important milestones for your project. A milestone is an event with a date that requires tracking. For example, you can have a milestone for final inspection and release to procurement. Each milestone typically has three dates associated with it: a planned date, a forecasted date, and an actual date.   For tracking and monitoring milestones, you need to create planning items. You can create a planning item for both a tag number and a requisition. While creating a planning item, you need to assign a milestone set to it. A milestone set is a group of related milestones. For example, you might have milestone sets for bulk materials and equipment.   Proper strategizing is an integral part of effective planning. For each planned requisition, you can define strategies for scoping, sourcing, expediting, inspection, and so on. With Smart Materials, you can also view the change history for a planned item. This includes changes to the planned item itself as well as changes to its milestones.  View the Intergraph Smart Materials Planning User's Guide for more information on planning tasks.   "},{"id":29,"title":"Getting Started with Suppliers","url":"819122.htm","text":"Managing suppliers is an extremely important part of materials management, and one of the most crucial tasks in the procurement phase. Selecting the right suppliers automatically increases your chances of project success. Apart from selecting the correct suppliers, you also need to track their performance in a consistent manner. You should also maintain their performance history for reference in the future projects.  Using Smart Materials, you can create an entry for each supplier and enter all details for the supplier, such as business information or how it will be used.  You can also enter sales information like the maximum value that an agreement with that supplier can have. You can also track a supplier&#8217;s rating in a project, the overall amount purchased from the supplier, diversity related information, and communication information.   Before you sign an agreement with a supplier, you need to assign the supplier to the appropriate material or service type. A material or service type represents a set of materials or services that a supplier is able to supply. Each supplier can be assigned to as many materials or services as necessary.

You also act as a liaison between the supplier and the freight forwarder.   The supplier and freight forwarder can view or update relevant packing related information in the Smart Materials Portal. You work in the Smart Materials application for viewing and managing the packages and shipments.  Your job begins when an agreement or engineering requisition is created and ends when the required materials or items arrive at the site. You spend a large amount of your time planning the work related to packing.  The two entities that help in the planning phase are:  Preliminary Packing List (PPL) - It helps in treating the preliminary packages as a logical unit for planning activities.  Preliminary Packages - A preliminary package is a conceptual object that is used for planning. Unlike a package, a preliminary package does not have any physical counterpart.  Generally, the supplier creates the PPLs and populates them with preliminary packages. Then, the supplier submits the PPLs to you. You can review the preliminary packages and the item shipments within them. If changes are required, you can ask supplies to make changes by requesting that they resubmit a PPL.  The actual packing process begins after the expediter creates the release notes, also known as packing lists. The supplier creates the packages for a packing list and ensures that all the items mentioned in the packing lists are included in packages. Then the supplier submits the release notes for your approval. After you approve a packing list, the supplier starts the physical packing process.

Each agreement status is associated with a priority, and the agreements are sorted by this priority from high to low. The lower a priority number is, the higher is the priority and the more attention should be paid to it. For example, open and delayed agreements require more attention than agreements that are already closed. When grouping the agreements, the status with the highest priority of the grouped agreements is shown. For example, if there are delayed and approved agreements for a supplier, the supplier&#8217;s status will be Delayed.  Which agreements are displayed depends on your privileges (Buyer).  Only users with the BUYER privilege can be assigned to an agreement as a buyer. The buyer can display and maintain his own agreements, that is, the agreements where he is assigned as a buyer.   Procurement managers with the ASSIGN BUYER privilege can assign buyers to agreements. These managers can view all agreements of the project(s).  If you don't have either the BUYER or the ASSIGN BUYER privilege, no agreements appear in the tree.  Because privilege assignment can vary from project to project, the display of the agreements can be different depending on the selected project.  If sections are used, the displayed agreements are restricted to the sections assigned to you (Section).  Sections can be used to limit the number of agreements that are available for a user. Agreements without any section assigned are available for all users.   If a section is assigned to an agreement, this agreement only appears if you have permission for this section. The permission for sections can be assigned on the user security level or on the role level. If sections are assigned on the user security level, these sections are used to restrict the displayed agreements. If no section is assigned on the user security level, the software checks the roles assigned to the login user.   The user gets the most he is allowed due to his settings. That is, for example, if one user security for a project allows for only limited access due to the assigned section(s), and another user security for the same project allows full access, the user will have full access without any limitations with respect to sections. If at least one user security grants full access, the only restriction may come from any role assigned to the user. If at least one assigned role grants unlimited access, the sections are not limited.  On this screen, you can add or delete agreements, or select an agreement to edit.

Financial Details  Allows you to add financial details (currency, incoterm, payment type, and budget) to the agreement.  Delivery Details  Allows you to edit delivery details like routing method, delivery dates, and so forth. This section only appears for materials agreements (purchase orders).  Status  The Status section displays the agreement status. Examples for the status include the ready for approval indicator, the technical evaluation complete date, the effective date, and so forth.  Subcontract Status  This section is only displayed for subcontract agreements.  Signature  Allows you to sign a subcontract. This section only appears for subcontract agreements.  Notice to Proceed Details  This section is displayed only for NTP (Notice to Proceed) agreements and for agreements that were created from an NTP, using the Switch Type button.

Financials  In the Financials section, you can select the following options:   Other Costs  Other costs of an agreement such as freight or special fees that are not necessarily associated with the material purchased can be edited in the Other Costs section.  Total Costs  In the Total Costs section, you can see the total costs of the agreement, grouped by currency.  Progress Payment Events  Use the Progress Payment Events section to assign progress payment events to the agreement.  Forecast Payments  Use the Forecast Payments section to view the forecasted payments for the pre-defined progress payment events.  Guarantees  In the Guarantees section, you can record the receipt and return of supplier guarantees. Guarantees can be entered or modified at any time.
