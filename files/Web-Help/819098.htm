<p class="bodytext">Planning is an extremely important part of materials management. Without proper planning, your organization might end up spending much more in the procurement and construction phase. With Smart Materials, you can define milestones for your project, and you can track the progress of important activities at the same time. You can also define and change your strategies for meeting your milestones.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The first step of planning is to identify the important milestones for your project. A milestone is an event with a date that requires tracking. For example, you can have a milestone for final inspection and release to procurement. Each milestone typically has three dates associated with it: a planned date, a forecasted date, and an actual date. </p>

<p class="bodytext">For tracking and monitoring milestones, you need to create planning items. You can create a planning item for both a tag number and a requisition. While creating a planning item, you need to assign a milestone set to it. A milestone set is a group of related milestones. For example, you might have milestone sets for bulk materials and equipment. </p>
<p class="bodytext">Proper strategizing is an integral part of effective planning. For each planned requisition, you can define strategies for scoping, sourcing, expediting, inspection, and so on. With Smart Materials, you can also view the change history for a planned item. This includes changes to the planned item itself as well as changes to its milestones.</p>
