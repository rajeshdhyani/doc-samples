<p class="bodytext">As soon as an agreement of type PO (purchase order) or NOC (notice of commitment) is approved, it is available in the Expediting module. The expediter is now responsible for the agreement until the material is received on site.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><a id="h393252" class="expandingblocktemplate" title="Expediting dashboard" href="javascript:toggleBlock('393252')" target="_self"><img id="i393252" class="expandicon" src="arrowright.gif" alt="" border="0">Expediting dashboard</a></p>
<div id="d393252" class="expandingblock" style="display:none"><p class="bodytext">Allows you to view all agreements in a hierarchic tree view. Next to each agreement the status shows if the agreement is delayed or already received on site. The agreements displayed on the tree can be grouped by different criteria. Which agreements are displayed depends on the status of the agreement and the sections assigned to the user. Only approved agreements are displayed. As soon as all supplements of the agreement are closed the agreement is no longer displayed.</p>
<ul class="listbullet"><li class="listbullet">The Expediting dashboard consists of the navigation panel on the left, and a details panel on the right.</li></ul><p class="bodytext"><a id="h472025" class="expandingblocktemplate" title="Section" href="javascript:toggleBlock('472025')" target="_self"><img id="i472025" class="expandicon" src="arrowright.gif" alt="" border="0">Section</a></p>
<div id="d472025" class="expandingblock" style="display:none"><p class="bodytext">Sections can be used to limit the number of agreements that are available for a user. Agreements without any section assigned are available for all users. </p>
<p class="bodytext">If a section is assigned to an agreement, this agreement only appears if you have permission for this section. The permission for sections can be assigned on the user security level or on the role level. If sections are assigned on the user security level, these sections are used to restrict the displayed agreements. If no section is assigned on the user security level, the software checks the roles assigned to the login user. </p>
<p class="bodytext">The user gets the most he is allowed due to his settings. That is, for example, if one user security for a project allows for only limited access due to the assigned section(s), and another user security for the same project allows full access, the user will have full access without any limitations with respect to sections. If at least one user security grants full access, the only restriction may come from any role assigned to the user. If at least one assigned role grants unlimited access, the sections are not limited.</p>
